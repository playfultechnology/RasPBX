# RasPBX Background
Installation of Asterisk and FreePBX GUI on Raspberry Pi

 - "[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/)" is a PBX communication server
 - "[FreePBX](https://github.com/FreePBX)" is a front-end that exposes Asterisk functionality via a web-based GUI
 - "FreePBX Distro" (previously called "AsteriskNow") was a pre-configured bundle distribution of Asterisk/FreePBX system based on CentOS. But now discontinued.
 - "[RaspPBX](http://www.raspbx.org/)" is a pre-configured bundle distribution of Asterisk/FreePBX based on Raspbian Buster 10, Asterisk 16.13.0, and FreePBX 15.0.16.75. The latest version is from 2020-10-10, but is no longer supported.

So... this repository intends to document the process of creating an up-to-date Asterisk installation on a Raspberry Pi, based on latest releases as follows:
 - Asterisk 22 (2025-01-09)
 - FreePBX 17 (2024-08-02)
 - Rasp Pi OS, Debian 12 Bookworm (2024-11-19)
